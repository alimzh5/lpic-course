`su - ali` is about loging mode that user logged in at first and `su ali` is about non-login mode so some environmet of last user come here

for changing to root user you can do `sudo su - root` and for ubuntu we cant use root user at first brcause there is no password for root but when you do the `sudo passwd root` you can set the password for root(with sudoers user)

`userdel` is for deleting the user
with `-r` you can delete the directory too

for deleting the group you can use `groupdel` cut befor that you need to change users that this group is their main group

bootloader: loading the kernel

diffrence beatween reboot and restart is that restart is for one service and came out from memmory but reboot is for all of the system.
restart shut down the power of the system but reboot no!

with `init 'number'` you can change your run level

File Descriptions
/etc/skel/
This is a template directory. When a new user is created, the files in /etc/skel/ are copied to the user's home directory (e.g., ~/.bash_profile, ~/.bashrc, etc.).
➤ Used for initializing user environments.

~/.bash_profile
This is executed once when a user logs in with a login shell (e.g., SSH, TTY login).
➤ Usually used to set environment variables, and it often calls ~/.bashrc manually like this:
```
if [ -f ~/.bashrc ]; then
    source ~/.bashrc
fi
```
```
~/.bashrc
```
This is executed whenever a new interactive non-login shell is started (like opening a terminal emulator).
➤ Contains aliases, functions, and shell customization.

/etc/bashrc (or sometimes /etc/bash.bashrc on Debian)
This is a global bashrc, sourced by every user’s ~/.bashrc.
➤ Sets system-wide defaults like prompt color, global aliases, etc.


Sourcing Flow (Execution Order)
Here’s how the shell configuration files are sourced depending on the shell type:

✅ Login shell (e.g. SSH, first terminal login):
`~/.bash_profile` is executed.

Inside `~/.bash_profile`, it checks and sources `~/.bashrc`.

`~/.bashrc` then sources `/etc/bashrc` (if coded to do so).

So the execution chain is:
➤ `~/.bash_profile` → `~/.bashrc` → `/etc/bashrc`

✅ Non-login interactive shell (e.g. terminal opened from GUI):
`~/.bashrc` is executed.

`~/.bashrc` may source /etc/bashrc.

Kernel Log - Summary
What is Kernel Log?
Kernel logs are messages generated by the Linux kernel. They include:

Boot process information

Hardware detection

Driver messages

Security events

System errors and warnings

How to View Kernel Logs:

Using dmesg
Shows kernel messages from boot time.
```
dmesg
dmesg | grep usb   # Filtered output
```
Log Files (usually in `/var/log/`):

File	Description
`/var/log/kern.log`	Kernel-specific log (Debian-based systems)
`/var/log/syslog`	General system log including kernel (Ubuntu)
`/var/log/messages`	General log (Red Hat-based systems)

Note: Use `sudo` to access some logs.

Useful Tips:

Good for debugging hardware, drivers, or kernel modules.

Can filter messages by type (e.g., errors, warnings).

Logs start fresh every reboot unless persistent logging is configured.
