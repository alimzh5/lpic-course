# CPU Architecture: RISC vs. CISC
## 1. RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computer)

Uses a small and simple set of instructions.

Each instruction typically takes one clock cycle to execute.

Emphasizes speed and efficiency.

Easier for pipelining and parallel execution.

Examples: ARM, MIPS, RISC-V.

## 2. CISC (Complex Instruction Set Computer)

Uses a large and complex set of instructions.

A single instruction can perform multiple low-level operations.

Instructions may take multiple clock cycles.

Designed to reduce the number of instructions in a program.

Examples: x86, VAX, System/360.

## Summary:

RISC → fewer, simpler instructions → faster execution per instruction.

CISC → more complex instructions → fewer instructions per program but possibly slower per instruction.
