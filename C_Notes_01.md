# CPU Architecture: RISC vs. CISC
## 1. RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computer)

Uses a small and simple set of instructions.

Each instruction typically takes one clock cycle to execute.

Emphasizes speed and efficiency.

Easier for pipelining and parallel execution.

Examples: ARM, MIPS, RISC-V.

## 2. CISC (Complex Instruction Set Computer)

Uses a large and complex set of instructions.

A single instruction can perform multiple low-level operations.

Instructions may take multiple clock cycles.

Designed to reduce the number of instructions in a program.

Examples: x86, VAX, System/360.

## Summary:

RISC → fewer, simpler instructions → faster execution per instruction.

CISC → more complex instructions → fewer instructions per program but possibly slower per instruction.

## Common CPU Architectures
**8086** – Intel’s original 16-bit x86 processor, basis of modern PC architecture.

**x86** – 32-bit Intel architecture, common in PCs and laptops.

**x86_64 (x64 / AMD64)** – 64-bit extension of x86, supports more memory and registers.

**ARM** – RISC-based architecture widely used in mobile devices and embedded systems.

**MIPS** – RISC architecture used in embedded systems, networking, and older consoles.

**RISC-V** – Open-source RISC architecture, modular and customizable.

**PowerPC** – RISC architecture used in older Apple computers, game consoles, and embedded devices.

**SPARC** – RISC architecture developed by Sun Microsystems, used in servers and workstations.

**Itanium (IA-64)** – Intel’s 64-bit architecture designed for high-end servers (now discontinued).

**Z80** – 8-bit microprocessor widely used in early computers and embedded devices.
